  <h2>Now Now Now</h2>
  <p>This year is all about <b>distributilized</b> data and apps, privacy protection and integrity and their applicability. Aside from consulting MaidSafe on the API layer and App SDKs of <a href="https://safenetwork.org/">the SAFE Network</a>, I am volunteering with <a href="https://swarm.???/">Swarm</a> - the Ethereum pendent, experiment on how to build complex apps ontop of these and am writing a book about that.</p>
  <p>Further more, I am getting deeper into <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a>, a memory safe systems programming language, help organising <a href="http://www.rustfest.eu/">RustFest</a>, continue to organise, coach and mentor with <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org/">OpenTechSchool Berlin</a> and curate <a href="http://www.arewewebyet.org/">AreWeWebYet</a>.</p>
