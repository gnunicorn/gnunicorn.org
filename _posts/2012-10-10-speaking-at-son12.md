Just got the notice that my talk was accepted for this years [Summit of New Thinking]() on November 16th, 2012. I'll be talking about how we use Git and [Github](https://github.com) at the [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org) to create, manage and host our learners material. If you happen to be at the conference, I'd happy to see at my speech. And feel free to bug me at any time to talk about this or any other related topic.

[Here](http://open-strategies.de/sessions/opencurriculum-github-for-the-win) is my except:

> "OpenCurriculum - github for the win" describes how the coaches of OpenTecSchool use git and github to create their workshop materials, track errors and provide fixes during workshops in real time. With its close look on how to execute this practically the talk also wants to provide a blue print on how to use github for collaborative projects beyond code.
