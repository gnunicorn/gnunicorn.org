[A great talk by Martens Mickos](http://www.heavybit.com/library/video/2013-10-15-marten-mickos), former CEO of MySQL AB and now CEO of Eucalyptus Systems,  in 2013 about the few OpenSource-Business models that actually work and the principles behind it.

I especially would like to quote:

> "When you run on Amazon, you run on your credit card and when you run on Eucalyptus you run on your servers."
> And smart people want a choice of where they run. 

and

> If you are aiming to become a successful, profitable, fantastic open source company you must know that there can be software coming out of end user organizations that will affect your business. In good or bad. 

but not least

> **There are always people who will spend any amount of time to save money, and there are other people who will spend money in order to save time.**
>
> Typically in your life, or in the life of a company, you go from one to the other. 

Go, watch it yourself at **[heavybit library](http://www.heavybit.com/library/video/2013-10-15-marten-mickos)**.
